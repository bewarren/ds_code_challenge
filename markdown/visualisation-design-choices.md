# Design Principles

- I tried to keep the first graph as simple as possible so I just chose a simple bar graph with a light colour to show the service requests.

- For the second graph I tried a few groupings and found grouping by 10,000s and 100,000s to be easiest to see as you zoom in and out.
- For the second graph, I also chose distinct coloursof pink, yellow, and blue to highlight the differences in grouping
