# Data Driven Storytelling

## Top graph

- The top graph shows the service requests by suburb ordered by the suburbs with the most service requests first
- You can expand the list of suburbs using the slider to show more suburbs
- This allows you to see how the suburbs with the most service request compare to all the suburbs

## Bottom Graph

- The bottom graph shows the service request by suburb on a map
- It is grouped by 100,000 up and 10,000 up
- This allows you to see the density of service requests per suburb

## Conclusion

- Based on these graphs, one can see that the majority of service requests occur in the suburbs around the Cape Flats and Townships in Cape Town, so the majority of resources should be allocated to these areas in order to deal with the water and sanitation service requests.
